> NOTE: To work with the Basecamp connector, you need to have a Basecamp account. If you do not have a Basecamp account, go to [https://basecamp.com/](https://basecamp.com/) and create a Basecamp trial account.

To use the Basecamp connector, add the <googlepubsub.init> element in your configuration before any other Basecamp operation. This configuration authenticates with Basecamp via user credentials.

Basecamp uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. All requests to the Basecamp API must be authorized by an authenticated user.

    2. Give proper values for Name of Your Application, Your companyâ€™s name, Your website URL, and Redirect URL
    3. Then click **Register this App**, It assign a client id and client secret and  Make a note of the client id and client secret.
    4. Next, get the Authorization code from Azure Access Control Service Construct the authorization url as: **https://<i></i>launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/new?type=web_server&client_id=your-client-id&redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri**.
    6. It ask whether it's ok to give access to your app. Click on **Yes,I'll allow access**. 
    7. Then get the access token and refresh token from code, construct the post request URL: **https:/<i></i>/launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/token?type=web_server&client_id=your-client-id&redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri&client_secret=your-client-secret&code=verification-code**.
